# Tickets: what goes in one, and how one ends

Read this when you write an issue, put one on the loop, or close one.
[`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/loop-task.md`](../.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/loop-task.md) is the shape; this file is why.

## What goes in

A ticket says what has to be true and how anyone can tell. It doesn't say how
to write the code: the rules in [`AGENTS.md`](../AGENTS.md) and the steering already do.

The sections are Stelliad's Ticket Authoring Standard, so `stelliad:create-ticket`
writes this shape and `stelliad:review-ticket` grades it. Its checker blocks on
a missing required section, whatever else the ticket gets right.

| Section | Holds | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| **Objective** | The outcome when it's done, in one or two sentences. At least 8 words | It describes a task or a feeling ("make the gate better") rather than a result |
| **Why** | The reason, legible to someone who wasn't there. At least 12 words | It leans on a conversation the reader didn't have |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Flat `- [ ]` items, one observable outcome each, in order, failure behaviour included | Nobody could check one. "Works well" is not a check |
| **Scope** | **In:** what it changes. **Out:** what it leaves alone | The Out half is missing |
| **Risk** | Low, Medium, High or Critical, with a reason for the top two | It's missing |
| Verification, Context, Dependencies, References | Only when they carry something: a command the tests can't express, a past decision, `Depends on #N`, files to start from | They're there as `N/A`, or References turns into instructions for writing the code |

The standard also allows Requirements, Constraints, Assumptions and Human
Approval, on the same terms, and `stelliad:create-ticket` writes them when they
apply. The title starts with a verb and names the outcome: "Make `--issue N`
exit when the issue is done", not "Loop bug".

Write a criterion as behaviour you can observe, and let the test prove it:
"`run --issue 12` returns once #12 has a pull request, proved by a new test in
[`tests/test_loop.py`](../tests/test_loop.py)", not "add `test_issue_exits`".

**One change per ticket.** If the acceptance criteria hold two unrelated
outcomes, it's two tickets. If it can't fit one pull request, split it so each
part can be tested on its own.

`stelliad:create-ticket` also suggests priority and risk labels. The starter
ships only the loop's labels, so it says when one is missing, and that's fine
to leave.

## Ready for the loop

Label an issue `loop-ready` only when all of these hold. The `loop-control`
skill checks them and asks before it labels.

- Someone has read the whole issue, comments included. A ticket is an
  instruction to an agent, and the loop acts on it with nobody watching.
- At least one acceptance criterion is a test that fails now and passes
  after, which the loop's `test_command` runs. If the proof is something
  else, the loop can't see it, and the reviewer only reads.
- Where Stelliad is installed, `stelliad:review-ticket` says READY. Its
  docs call the Ready label `agent-ready`; here it's `loop-ready`, applied
  through `loop-control`.
- Nothing outside the repo: no deploy, no message, no credentials, nothing the
  guard would refuse.
- Risk is Low or Medium, and there's no Human Approval section. The loop runs
  with nobody watching, so nothing in a ticket can make it stop and ask.
- Its dependencies can be left to the loop. It waits until each `Depends on
  #N` line's issues, and each issue GitHub lists as blocking it, are closed
  as completed, so `loop-ready` can go on a dependent issue straight away. One
  closed as not planned, a number that isn't an issue, or a cycle blocks it
  with a comment. The loop doesn't read priority: of the issues with nothing
  left to wait for, it takes the lowest-numbered.
- It isn't assigned to someone else.

## While it's worked

The loop comments on the issue twice at most, so the issue tells the story
without the machine that ran it:

- **A pull request opened:** the link, how many rounds it took, and that the
  tests and review passed.
- **Blocked:** why, the round count, and that the plan, test output and review
  are in `.loop/issue-N/` on the machine that ran it.

A person commenting adds what changed: a decision, a narrowed scope, an
answer to a question the review raised. A comment that changes the
acceptance criteria changes the ticket, so edit the description too. The loop reads the
description, not the comments.

## How it ends

- **Done:** the pull request that does it says `Closes #N`, and merging it
  closes the issue. The loop writes that line itself. A pull request a person
  opens writes it too. GitHub only acts on it when the pull request merges
  into the repo's default branch; one that lands somewhere else first leaves
  the issue for a person to close.
- **Blocked:** stays open with `loop:blocked`. Fix the ticket (usually the
  acceptance criteria), take `loop:blocked` off, put `loop-ready` back. The loop picks
  up where it left off, on its old `loop/issue-N` branch. For a clean start,
  delete that branch and its checkout under `~/.harness-loop/` first.
- **Not doing it:** close it as not planned, with one line saying why.

Never close an issue whose acceptance criteria haven't been checked.
