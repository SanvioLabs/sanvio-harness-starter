"""Summarize the Claude Code tokens spent under this harness, as Markdown.

    python3 scripts/token_report.py --since 2026-10-01
    python3 scripts/token_report.py --projects /some/other/.claude/projects

Reads Claude Code's own transcripts, ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl, subagents
included, and counts the tokens on each reply whose working folder is this
harness: conversations at its root, each repo under projects/, and each issue
the loop built in its worktrees. Nothing it prints holds a prompt, a reply, a
file path or a line of code: counts, model names, session ids, issue names,
and for the loop, estimated dollars. Claude Code only: Codex, Kiro and other
tools keep their own logs. The dollars are the estimate at API prices each loop
run recorded in .loop/**/usage.json, not what was billed; a conversation's
transcript carries no cost, so it stays in tokens. A last section splits the
conversations at the root by subagent type, skill and slash command, a skill's
or command's share attributed from where it started to the next prompt. The
skills/harness-report/ skill runs this next to usage_report.py.
