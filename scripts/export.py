"""Bundle your loop and usage numbers into one JSON file, kept on this machine.

    python3 scripts/export.py                         # the last 14 days, printed
    python3 scripts/export.py --since 2026-10-01 --out reports/usage/export.json

The bundle holds:

- `v`, `exported`, `since`: the format version, today's date and the first day counted
- `user`: the same cleaned name your usage log's filename uses, so no new identifier
- `loop`: the lines of .loop/history.jsonl since that day, each rebuilt from the keys
  scripts/loop.py writes and nothing else. Only the harness's own loop: nothing under
  .loop/projects/ is read, and a line tagged with a project is dropped
- `usage`: counts from your usage log, .harness/usage/<you>.jsonl: sessions, then
  skills, agents and slash commands by name, guard refusals by rule, and guard asks
  and the asks you said yes to by tool (or by rule when there's no tool)

Nothing sends it. It only reads, prints or writes the one file you name. This shape is
the only one any later sender may send: anything not in it stays on this machine.
