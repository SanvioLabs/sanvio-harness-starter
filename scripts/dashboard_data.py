"""The numbers a harness dashboard shows, as JSON.

    python3 scripts/dashboard_data.py --json                    # the last 14 days
    python3 scripts/dashboard_data.py --json --since 2026-10-01

--json is the only output, and the script refuses to run without it. It prints one object:

    generated        when it ran, an ISO time with the local offset
    since            the first day counted
    loop_spend       tokens and estimated dollars from the loop's .loop/**/usage.json records: today,
                     the last 7 days and since --since, each keyed on when the loop picked the issue
                     up, then the --since totals by issue, step and model. A run that recorded no
                     model is under "null". cost_per_pr is, over the issues that ran since --since
                     and are in status.json, their cost over how many have a pull request,
                     or null when none has one. by_day lists every day from --since to today, oldest
                     first, each with its tokens and cost_usd, 0 and 0.0 on a day with no run, and
                     cost_usd null on a day whose runs recorded no cost. run_started is local time,
                     so a run dated after today only comes from a wrong clock: it counts in since
                     but has no day. first_run is the earliest day a run counted since --since
                     started, or null
    loop_throughput  the issues in .loop/status.json and each project's: how many are in each
                     state, each one's round, and how many took more than one
    activity         your usage log, .harness/usage/<you>.jsonl, since --since: skills, agents and
                     slash commands by name, guard refusals by rule, and how many times it asked
    evals            the newest file in .harness/evals/ for each reviewer: when it was saved, how
                     many cases were stable, flaky and failing, and the failing cases' names. stale
                     is true when a file the result rests on changed after it was saved: the agent's
                     file in agents/, scripts/eval_agents.py, or a case's case.json, work file or
                     brief. A file changed when its last commit is later than saved, or when it has
                     uncommitted changes, or git ignores it, and it was written later. A file that
                     doesn't exist and was never committed can't count. changed lists those files from the harness
                     root, and newest_change is the latest of their dates. A result with no saved
                     time or no cases in its folder is stale with a why, and one git can't check
                     has stale null with a why
    conversations    Claude Code's tokens since --since from ~/.claude/projects, counted as
                     token_report.py counts them: "harness" for conversations at the root and in
                     projects/, "loop" for the loop's worktrees, each by model (input, output, cache
                     writes, cache reads and total) with how many sessions, and by_day, every day
                     from --since to today, oldest first, the same days as loop_spend's, with its
                     total tokens, 0 on a day with no reply. A reply's day there is local time, as a
                     loop run's is, so the evening stays on its own day; --since and by_model go by
                     the transcript's UTC date, as token_report.py does, so west of UTC a reply on
                     the evening before --since counts in by_model but has no day. What each
                     transcript held is kept in .harness/cache/conversations.json and read again
                     only when the file's size or time changes: per reply, its message and request
                     ids, UTC day, side, model, session id, local day and counts, under the
                     transcript's path, and nothing else
    waiting          what's waiting on you, in two halves that each fail on their own: pull_requests,
                     the harness repo's open pull requests from gh, each with its title, when it
                     opened, hours waited, its loop issue if its branch is loop/issue-N, whether it's
                     a draft, its checks (pass, fail, pending, or null with none) and whether it
                     conflicts (null while GitHub doesn't know); and blocked, the issues in
                     status.json whose state is blocked, each with its title, note and last update
    loop_rework      the loop's pull requests (branch loop/issue-N) merged since --since, read through
                     gh: how many, how many gained a commit without the loop's "Loop: issue #" line,
                     and each of those with its number, title, merges from main and other commits.
                     A pull request's commits are cached in .harness/cache/loop_rework.json, so
                     each is asked for once

A section whose source is missing or can't be read is {"value": null, "why": ...}, and the why names
the kind of problem, never a path or an error's text. The script still exits 0. status.json keeps
only the loop's 20 most recent issues, so throughput covers those whatever --since says, and
cost_per_pr leaves out an issue that ran in the period but has dropped off the list. loop_rework reads
the 200 most recently merged pull requests, so a --since far enough back can undercount it. Titles
appear only under waiting and loop_rework, and notes only under waiting, printed as they were written,
so they hold whatever was typed into them. Nowhere else does it print a title or a note, and nowhere
does it add a pull request's address, a prompt, a commit's message or author, an eval's reasons or a
file path other than those in changed, which are from the harness root: counts, dollars, dates, issue
names, step, model, skill, agent, rule and case names. The dollars are the loop's estimate at API
prices, not what was billed.
