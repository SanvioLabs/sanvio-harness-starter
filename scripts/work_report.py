"""What got done in a repo over a period, from GitHub and its CHANGELOG, for a work report.

    python3 scripts/work_report.py                       # the harness, since 14 days ago, as Markdown
    python3 scripts/work_report.py --since 2026-10-01
    python3 scripts/work_report.py --project app         # a repo under projects/ instead
    python3 scripts/work_report.py --json

It reads, through gh, in the harness root or the repo under projects/:

    pull_requests  each pull request merged on or after --since, through one GraphQL search: its number,
                   title, address, author's login, when it opened and merged, the issues it closes, the
                   milestones it and those issues are on, who else reviewed it and who else approved it,
                   the specs its closed issues name, and its type. loop_built is true when its branch is loop/issue-N, the branch the loop
                   opens; the loop opens it as whoever runs the loop, so it counts as that login's. A
                   review counts when its author isn't the pull request's and isn't a bot (GitHub's Bot
                   type, which gh's own reviews field doesn't show), and isn't pending or dismissed. An
                   approval is such a review in the APPROVED state, read on its own so a long thread of
                   comments can't push it out of the first REVIEWS. Its type is the first of TYPES
                   among its own labels, or else among its closed issues' labels, or null: never a
                   guess from its branch or title
    totals         counts over those, and the median minutes from opened to merged
    by_person      for each login that authored or reviewed one: the same counts, and reviews_given, how
                   many of the others' pull requests it reviewed
    by_type        merged and loop_built for each of TYPES, then untyped
    by_day         every UTC day from --since to today's UTC date, oldest first, with merged and loop_built
    milestones     GitHub milestones: closed, the ones closed on or after --since, and open, each with
                   how many of what's on it are done and still open (GitHub counts its pull requests
                   with its issues) and its due date
    releases       releases published on or after --since, drafts left out, from the newest RELEASES
    specs          for each spec a closed issue names, the pull requests that closed one. An issue names
                   it with a line "Spec: <path> [requirement ...]", as a bullet or not; the path, its
                   first word, is the spec, and N/A or none names none
    changelog      the entries dated on or after --since in CHANGELOG.md on GitHub's default branch, so
                   only what merged, newest first: what shipped, in words. It reads headings of the shape
                   "## YYYY-MM-DD: Name", and says so when the file has none
    watch          sentences on what a lead would ask about: merged work nobody else approved, work on no
                   milestone or spec, work with no type, a milestone closed late or with issues open, one past its due date,
                   and a search that stopped at its limit

Milestones are only what GitHub records: a release or a closed milestone. It never picks one, and a
CHANGELOG entry is not a milestone.

Unlike the other reports here, this one names people. It prints each pull request's author, reviewers
and approvers by GitHub login, with its number, title and address, because a lead reads it to see who
did what. It never prints an issue's or a pull request's body, beyond the one "Spec:" line's value,
nor a commit message, a diff or an email.

A section whose source is missing or can't be read is {"value": null, "why": ...}, and the script still
exits 0. GitHub's search returns at most LIMIT pull requests; truncated says when there were more, and
then the counts are low. The search gets SEARCH_TIMEOUT seconds in all.
