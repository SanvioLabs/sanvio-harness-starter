"""The loop: take a ready issue, plan it, build it, check it, open a pull request.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/loop.py run [--once] [--issue N] [--dry-run] [--for DURATION] [--hours HOURS] [--project PATH]
    python3 scripts/loop.py review [--once] [--for DURATION] [--hours HOURS] [--project PATH]
    python3 scripts/loop.py stop [--project PATH]

One pass is one turn of the flywheel:

    Discover  pick the next open issue labelled loop-ready
    Shape     a fresh agent writes the smallest plan that would count
    Build     a fresh agent makes the change in a git worktree
    Validate  this script runs your tests, a second fresh agent reviews the diff
    Scale     on PASS open a pull request, note what went wrong, take the next one

Build and Validate repeat up to max_rounds. Then the issue is labelled
loop:blocked and the loop moves on without it.

`review` is the other half of the queue: it reviews each open pull request that asks for you,
once per head commit, with skills/review-pr, and posts the report as one comment per pull
request, edited in place on later commits. It never approves, merges or pushes.

--for 8h (or 90m, 2d) on either one starts nothing new once that long has passed, lets what's
running finish, and then exits, logging an END line. An UNTIL line at the start says when.

hours in loop.json, or --hours, such as "Mon-Fri 09:00-17:00", is when either one may start
something, in local time. Outside them it starts nothing, lets what's running finish, logs an HOURS
line once with the next start, and waits. A window that crosses midnight, Fri 22:00-06:00, belongs
to the day it starts.

Watch it with:  tail -f .loop/loop.log
The same state, for a tool to read, is in .loop/status.json: what's waiting, what each
issue is on, and how its last round went. Run inside tmux, a START line in the log and the
status name the session, so `tmux attach -t <name>` opens it. On macOS the run also writes
.loop/watch.command, which opens a read-only Terminal window on it (the loop pane's Watch it),
and .loop/issue-N/watch.command for each issue's window (the pane's Watch on that issue).
Everything a round produced is in .loop/issue-N/, and agent.log there is what its agents said, as
they said it. Checkouts live outside the clone, in ~/.harness-loop/. It never merges.

max_workers in loop.json (default 1) is how many issues it works at once, each on its own thread
and each agent its own session, so usage grows with it. Inside tmux each issue gets a window,
issue-N, that follows its agent.log and closes when the issue ends. An issue whose Scope names a
path a running issue's Scope names waits for it, with a HELD line in the log.

--project projects/<name> works a clone under projects/ instead of the harness: its GitHub repo's
issues and pull requests, its loop.json, which has to set test_command, and its checkouts under
~/.harness-loop/<harness>/<name>/. Its state stays in the harness, in .loop/projects/<name>/. The
agents get the harness's rules in their prompts, and a claude build agent the harness's guard.
