    python3 scripts/plugin_report.py
    python3 scripts/plugin_report.py --previous reports/usage/2026-10-10-pat.md

Runs `claude plugin list --json` and keeps the enabled plugins and mods that
apply here: installed for the user, or for this harness's folder. Each prints as
its id, version and scope, and nothing else: no install folder and no path. With
--previous, a harness report from an earlier sprint, it also says which plugins
changed version, arrived or went since that report's date, read from the
report's own table. Claude Code only. If claude isn't installed or its answer
isn't JSON, it prints one line saying so and still exits 0, so a report can be
written without it. The skills/harness-report/ skill runs this next to
token_report.py.
