"""Draw the harness dashboard's README picture from the pane itself.

    python3 scripts/draw_dashboard.py

Runs the dashboard mod's tests with one more test of its own, which takes the
rows picture() in hooks/picture.test.ts lays out (the pane on the terminal, 66
columns wide, drawing hooks/sample.ts) and fails with them as one line,
PANE-ROWS <json>: a test has no console. This writes those rows as
docs/harness-dashboard.svg and as the text inside the README's <details>. Run it after changing how the
pane draws, or after sample.ts is written again: tests/test_draw_dashboard.py
fails while either is out of date.

The tests run in the machine's own time zone whatever TZ says, so picture()
reads at local noon. Needs Claude Code (claude) on the PATH. Exits 1 when the
tests fail or print no rows, or when its test file is already there, and
writes nothing then.
