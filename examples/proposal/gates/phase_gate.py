"""Phase gate: what a client's proposal is missing before the work can enter a phase.

Usage:
    python3 examples/proposal/gates/phase_gate.py <shape|build> <client>

<client> is the proposal's file name without .md (juniper-bakery), or its path.
For each gap it names what closes it: a skill, an agent, or nobody but you. It
only reports. It never changes the proposal and never moves the phase on: that's
a person's call. Exits 0 when nothing is missing and 1 when something is.

The questions each phase asks are in steering/gates.md. The ones a script can
decide are here. Validate and Scale are a person's, so they aren't.
