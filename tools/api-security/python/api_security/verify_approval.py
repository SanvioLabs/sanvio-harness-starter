"""Signed approval for the guarded surface, SPEC-034 REQ-016, SEC-002, SEC-004.

    python3 verify_approval.py --base <base sha> --head <head sha> [--repo DIR]
                               [--author <PR author> --sender <event sender> --action <event action>]

Run by `security-approval.yml` on `pull_request_target`, from the BASE branch's copy of this file,
over the pull request's commits as git objects. It never checks out or executes anything from the
pull request.

The guarded surface is everything under `security/`, `.github/workflows/` and `.github/actions/`,
and `CODEOWNERS` wherever GitHub reads it (`.github/`, the root, `docs/`). Every workflow is guarded
because a required status matches by name, and no reading of a workflow's text can tell what name
a job will report under: it can take it from the pull request's own title. A local action runs
inside whatever workflow calls it. One change needs no signature: a pull request Dependabot
opened, judged on an `opened` or `synchronize` event that Dependabot sent, that moves only the
`@ref` of existing `uses:` lines in a workflow the base's `security/config.json` lists under
`dependabot_exempt_workflows` (opt-in, empty by default), and that is not a security workflow, not
listed under `deploy_workflows`, and not a reusable workflow (`workflow_call`). Content alone
cannot be the test: a commit that exists only in a fork resolves through the parent's path, so the
same action path is not the same publisher. A malformed list exempts nothing. The verifier judges
what would land: the three-way merge of the head into the base, the tree GitHub merges. A pull
request that changes a guarded file in that tree passes only when one commit in the pull
request, built on top of this base and signed with an SSH key listed in the base's
`security/allowed_signers`, holds exactly what lands across the whole guarded surface. A signed
change lands whole or not at all. Removing lines from `security/public-routes.txt` is the one
change that needs no signature.

A signed commit that does not contain the base it is judged against does not count: an old signed
commit could otherwise be replayed over a later fix. So after updating a branch from its base, sign
the update.

Exit 0 pass, 1 refused, 2 could not decide. 2 is a refusal too: the job fails closed.
Stdlib only, no imports from the package, so the base branch's copy runs on its own.
