# Session retro

A correction says what the agent got wrong. A retro says why it didn't know:
nothing said it, it wasn't loaded, it was loaded and ignored, something said the
opposite, or nothing could have. Each points at a different fix, and
[`skills/learn/`](../learn/) uses the cause to pick one. The loop's retro does
this for loop runs; this does it for ordinary sessions, with the same digest,
causes and checks from [`scripts/loop.py`](../../scripts/loop.py).

With `HARNESS_RETRO=on`, [`.claude/hooks/session_retro.py`](../../.claude/hooks/session_retro.py)
keeps a copy of each session's log where the person corrected the agent, or
one file was edited three or more times, in `local-data/retro/`. Off, nothing
is kept, and this skill reads the current session only.

## Steps

1. **Write the prompt.** Run `python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py prompt`.
   It takes the oldest kept session, or this one when none is kept, and writes
   the classifier's prompt to a file. Add `--current` to read this session
   whatever is kept. Tell the person which session it is and how many are
   waiting, from what it prints.
2. **Have a fresh agent classify it.** Give a new subagent only this: "Read
   `<the prompt file>` and do what it says. Reply with only its FINDING
   lines." It has to be fresh. An agent asked about its own session tends to
   make up the turn where it learned something. In a tool with no subagents,
   run it as a separate session.
3. **Record it.** Pass the subagent's reply, unchanged, to
   `python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py record <session id>` on stdin, with
   a quoted heredoc (`<<'EOF'`). It drops any finding it can't place in the log,
   appends an entry to `.loop/lessons.md` marked as from a session, and deletes
   the kept copy and the prompt file.
4. **Offer to learn from it.** Show the entry it printed, and offer
   [`skills/learn/`](../learn/) on it. The mistake and the right behaviour still
   come from the person.

## Rules

- Never write, change or add a finding yourself. The subagent classifies and
  the script checks.
- Never read the kept log or the prompt file into this session. The fresh
  agent reads them.
- Nothing from a session log, a prompt file or a lessons entry goes into a
  tracked file, a pull request, an issue, or anything that leaves this machine.
- If the person says a kept session needs no retro, run
  `python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py drop <session id>`. It deletes the
  copy and writes nothing.

## Output

The session's id, the entry written to `.loop/lessons.md`, and the lines it
printed about findings it dropped.
