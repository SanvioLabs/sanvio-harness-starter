# Spec: the lightweight loop

## Status

`Draft`. Four Open Questions are unresolved, and the real-repo run has not happened.

This spec was written after the first build, from what [`scripts/loop.py`](../../scripts/loop.py) does and what [`tests/test_loop.py`](../../tests/test_loop.py) proves. The requirements describe built behavior. The Open Questions are where it is still a guess.

## Summary

`scripts/loop.py` takes an open GitHub issue labelled `loop-ready` through the flywheel: plan it, build it, check it, open a pull request. It is the small version of a runner for a team with one repo, one agent tool and a person who wants to watch a plain log. It never merges.

## Problem

[`HOW-IT-WORKS.md`](../../HOW-IT-WORKS.md) said a bigger harness adds a runner that works tickets without a person at the keyboard, and the starter shipped none. A team that wanted one had to build it from nothing, or adopt a full runner built to manage many projects, dispatch by voice and steward pull requests. Either is far more than a first loop needs.

## Goals

1. One pass is one turn of the flywheel: Discover, Shape, Build, Validate, Scale, each a named step in the log.
2. The agent never grades its own work: the script runs the tests, and a pass needs both the tests and a fresh reviewer.
3. A person can watch it with `tail -f` and build their own monitor from the log and the per-issue files.
4. A failure ends in a labelled issue and a lesson, never in a loop that retries forever.
5. It is one standard-library file, small enough to read in one sitting and change.

## Non-Goals

- Running many projects or many issues at once.
- Merging. A person merges.
- A dispatcher, voice control, a dashboard, a database, or routing work to different models by tier.
- Holding credentials. It uses the person's own agent and `gh` sign-in.

## Affected Areas

```
Affected:
- scripts/loop.py
- tests/test_loop.py
- HOW-IT-WORKS.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md
- skills/learn/SKILL.md (reads .loop/lessons.md)
- .gitignore (.loop/)
```

## User Stories

| ID | Story |
|---|---|
| US-001 | As a team lead, I want ready issues worked through the same plan, build, check and review each time, so that I read pull requests, not transcripts. |
| US-002 | As a developer, I want one log I can tail, so that I know what the loop is doing without opening a dashboard. |
| US-003 | As the harness owner, I want what went wrong written down in a shape `learn` reads, so that a failure becomes a rule. |

## Requirements

| ID | Pattern | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| REQ-001 | Event-Driven | When `run` starts and no other loop holds the lock, the loop shall take the lowest-numbered open issue labelled `ready_label` that does not carry `blocked_label` and is unassigned or assigned to the signed-in user. |
| REQ-002 | Event-Driven | When an issue is taken, the loop shall write `ticket.md`, then a fresh reader agent's plan to `plan.md`, under `.loop/issue-N/`. |
| REQ-003 | Event-Driven | When a plan exists, the loop shall build in a git worktree on `loop/issue-N`, started from `origin/<base>`, outside the clone, using a fresh agent session whose prompt carries the plan and, after a failed round, the last review and test output. |
| REQ-004 | Event-Driven | When a round is built, the loop shall run `test_command` itself in the worktree and save its output, then run a fresh reader agent on the plan, the diff and that output. |
| REQ-005 | Ubiquitous | The loop shall count a round as passed only when the tests exit 0 and the last `VERDICT:` line of the review is PASS. A review with no verdict counts as FIX. |
| REQ-006 | Unwanted | If the reader agent leaves uncommitted changes in the worktree, then the loop shall discard them and log it. |
| REQ-007 | Unwanted | If a round fails `max_rounds` times, or an agent exits non-zero, then the loop shall remove `ready_label` from the issue, then add `blocked_label`, append a lesson, log BLOCKED, and go on to the next issue. |
| REQ-008 | Event-Driven | When a round passes, the loop shall push the branch, open a pull request against `base` without merging it, remove `ready_label`, and append a lesson if it took more than one round. |
| REQ-009 | Ubiquitous | The loop shall append one line per event to `.loop/loop.log` as `time #issue STEP detail`, with steps DISCOVER, SHAPE, BUILD, VALIDATE, SCALE, REVIEW, BLOCKED, STOPPED, IDLE and ERROR, and shall write no agent output or credential to it. |
| REQ-010 | Ubiquitous | The loop shall write each lesson to `.loop/lessons.md` as a heading, **What went wrong** and **What should have happened**, the shape `skills/learn` reads. |
| REQ-011 | Unwanted | If another live process holds `.loop/lock`, then `run` shall refuse and exit 1. A lock whose process is gone is replaced. |
| REQ-012 | Event-Driven | When `stop` is run, a running loop shall end at its next step and log STOPPED. |
| REQ-013 | Optional | Where `--dry-run`, `--once` or `--issue N` is given, the loop shall only name the issue it would take, take one issue, or take only that issue. |
| REQ-014 | Ubiquitous | The loop shall read its settings from `loop.json` at the repo root, each key defaulting when absent. |
| REQ-015 | Unwanted | If the issue is no longer open when a round passes, then the loop shall not push or open a pull request, and shall log that it skipped. |

## Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Requirement | Criteria | Verification |
|---|---|---|---|
| AC-001 | REQ-001 | Lowest ready issue wins; blocked, unlabelled and other people's issues are skipped | `test_pick_takes_the_lowest_ready_issue_you_may_take` |
| AC-002 | REQ-002, 003, 004, 008 | A good change logs the five steps in order and opens a pull request | `test_a_good_change_opens_a_pull_request_in_five_steps` |
| AC-003 | REQ-003 | The checkout is outside the clone | `test_checkouts_live_outside_the_clone` |
| AC-004 | REQ-003, 004 | Prompts carry the plan, the diff, the output and any earlier review | `test_prompts_carry_their_inputs_so_the_agent_needs_no_file_access` |
| AC-005 | REQ-005 | Failing tests block even when the reviewer says PASS; no verdict is FIX | `test_failing_tests_block_even_when_the_reviewer_says_pass`, `test_verdict_is_the_last_line_and_defaults_to_fix` |
| AC-006 | REQ-006 | A reviewer's edits do not reach the diff | `test_a_reviewer_that_edits_files_has_them_thrown_away` |
| AC-007 | REQ-007, 010 | After the limit the label comes off before blocked goes on, and a lesson is written | `test_a_change_that_keeps_failing_is_blocked_with_the_label_taken_off_first` |
| AC-008 | REQ-011 | A second loop is refused; a stale lock is replaced; another user's process is respected | the three lock tests |
| AC-009 | REQ-012 | A stop file ends the loop between steps | `test_a_stop_file_ends_the_loop_between_steps` |
| AC-010 | REQ-013 | Dry run names an issue and starts no agent; nothing ready logs IDLE once | `test_dry_run_names_the_issue_and_starts_no_agent`, `test_nothing_ready_logs_idle_once` |
| AC-011 | REQ-014 | Defaults overlay from `loop.json` | `test_config_overlays_defaults_from_loop_json` |
| AC-012 | REQ-015 | A change for an issue closed meanwhile pushes nothing and opens no pull request | `test_a_change_for_an_issue_closed_meanwhile_opens_no_pull_request` |

All run with `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests`. The tests use a temporary git repo, a stand-in agent and a stand-in `gh`.

Run by hand, not in CI: one ticket through a real `claude -p` (Haiku) in a scratch clone with a stand-in `gh`, 2026-10-09. It ended PASS in about 80 seconds.

## Security Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| SEC-001 | A ticket is an instruction to an agent. The loop shall act only on issues carrying `ready_label`, and the README shall say to label only issues the team wrote or read. |
| SEC-002 | The loop shall never merge, and shall never hold or read a credential. It runs on the person's own agent and `gh` sign-in. |
| SEC-003 | The reader agent shall be told not to edit, and any edit it makes shall be discarded (REQ-006). |

## Privacy / Compliance Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| PRIV-001 | Ticket text, the plan, the diff and the test output are sent to the agent the team configured, as in any session. The loop shall add no other destination. |
| PRIV-002 | The log shall carry issue numbers, step names and counts, never ticket text or agent output. |

## Infrastructure Requirements

None identified for this spec.

## Observability Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| OBS-001 | The log is the whole interface (REQ-009). The per-issue files are the second: `ticket.md`, `plan.md`, `test-output.txt`, `diff.patch`, `review.md`. |

## Database Requirements

None identified for this spec.

## Evaluation Requirements

None identified for this spec. The reviewer is an agent, and its noise is an Open Question below, not an evaluated behavior.

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-001 | One Python file, standard library only, Python 3.9 or newer, needing only `git` and a signed-in `gh`. |
| NFR-002 | Each agent call times out after `agent_timeout` seconds (1800), and the tests after `test_timeout`. A timeout is a failed round, not a hang. |

## Constraints

- Agents in a worktree cannot read the loop's own folder, so everything an agent needs goes in its prompt.
- A worktree nested inside the clone makes an agent load the clone's `CLAUDE.md` as well, which tells it to stop. Checkouts live in `~/.harness-loop/`.

## Dependencies

`git`, `gh`, and one agent tool that takes a prompt on stdin (`claude -p` by default; Codex works the same way).

## Out of Scope

- Issues from a `tickets/` folder for teams without GitHub issues.
- Running on a schedule or as a service.
- Resuming mid-round after a crash. A restart takes the issue again from Shape, on the existing branch.
- A spend or token limit per issue.

## Open Questions

1. **A real run.** The loop has not opened a real pull request from a real issue. The first one should be a small issue with `--once`.
2. **Other agent tools.** The defaults are `claude -p` flags. Codex and Kiro flags for "may edit" and "read only" are not tested.
3. **Reviewer noise.** In the live run the reviewer listed five problems and still said PASS. Should a PASS need an empty problem list, or is the verdict enough?
4. **When the ready label comes off.** It comes off when the pull request opens, so a closed or abandoned PR needs a person to relabel. Leave it on until merge instead?

## Decisions

Pat, 2026-10-09:

- **A setup warning in the plan:** document it, don't strip it. `HOW-IT-WORKS.md` tells the reader to run `scripts/check_setup.py` and fix any FAIL before the first run.
- **Shape stays its own session.** It costs one more agent call per issue and gives the builder and the reviewer the same plan.
- **A closed issue gets no pull request.** REQ-015.
