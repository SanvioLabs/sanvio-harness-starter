"""Session retro: keeps the log of a session where the agent got corrected, for skills/retro/ to read.

From the Sanvio Labs harness starter, MIT: https://github.com/SanvioLabs/sanvio-harness-starter

Wired in .claude/settings.json on SessionEnd and PreCompact. Off unless HARNESS_RETRO=on, because it
keeps a copy of a whole session log: everything said in it and every file it read. A session counts
when a message the person wrote opens with "no," or carries a phrase in CORRECTIONS, or one file was
edited EDITS_FOR_SIGNAL or more times. Its log is copied to local-data/retro/, readable by its owner
alone, and its id listed once in local-data/retro/candidates.txt. It copies nothing unless git says
that folder is ignored, so a .gitignore that lost the line can't put a session in a commit. A later
run copies it again, so a session that compacted and then ended keeps all of it. A run bin/harness
or scripts/loop.py started is never copied: nobody corrected it. Nothing here leaves this machine.

Each run also deletes whatever in local-data/retro/ is older than KEEP_DAYS, on or off, so turning it
off doesn't keep old copies forever. It never blocks, never prints, and never stops a session if it
fails.

skills/retro/ runs the rest through this file:

  python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py prompt [--current]
      writes the classifier's prompt for the oldest kept session, or this one when none is kept
  python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py classify <session id>
      has a fresh claude that can only read classify the prompt, and saves its reply beside it
  python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py record <session id>
      checks the saved reply's findings against the log, appends a session entry to .loop/lessons.md,
      and deletes the kept copy, the prompt and the reply
  python3 .claude/hooks/session_retro.py drop <session id>
      deletes a kept session the person says needs no retro, and writes nothing

The digest, the five causes and the checks are scripts/loop.py's, the same the loop's retro uses.
