"""Claude Code guard: runs before every tool call the agent makes.

From the Sanvio Labs harness starter, MIT: https://github.com/SanvioLabs/sanvio-harness-starter

Wired in .claude/settings.json as a PreToolUse hook. Four jobs:

1. Credentials stay unread. A Read, Edit or Write on a credential file, a Grep
   whose path or glob names one (or a .ssh, .aws, .gnupg or .kube folder) or
   whose glob can only match one, or a shell command that names one, is
   refused. Env files, .pem and .key files, keystores (.p12, .pfx, .jks,
   .keystore), SSH and GnuPG keys, cloud and Kubernetes config, service-account
   files, .htpasswd and Docker's login file all count. A path is checked as
   written and once resolved, in any case, so a link to one counts. Glob lists
   names without reading them, so it isn't, and nor is a Grep over a folder
   that happens to hold one: the guard sees the call's arguments, not the files
   the search opens.
2. A connector call that isn't a plain read asks first. An MCP tool runs
   unasked only when its name says it gets, lists, searches, reads, finds,
   queries, fetches or views, and nothing in it says it sends, creates, edits,
   deletes, shares, runs or executes. Any other is put to the human, so a tool
   nobody has seen yet asks rather than slips through. It goes by the name, so
   a read tool with an odd name (git_status) asks too.
3. The security-reviewer agent's shell runs audits and nothing else. It reads
   code someone else may have written, and that code can carry text meant to
   steer it. A command on the audit list runs without a prompt; any other is
   refused.
4. A run bin/harness started (HARNESS_HEADLESS=1) reads a pull request or an
   issue by number and nothing else. Nobody is watching it, and what it reads
   was written by someone else. Its shell runs only `gh pr view <n>`,
   `gh pr diff <n>` and `gh issue view <n>`, with `--comments` on a view, no
   connector runs at all, and its file tools (Read, Grep and Glob among them)
   reach only paths inside the harness root, after `..` and links resolve.
   Inside the root, they don't reach the files that hold tokens or company
   data: .claude/settings.local.json, any .git folder or bare repo (*.git),
   company/, local-data/ and a leftover .inbox/. Each headless Grep is passed
   on with !*.git added to its glob, so it leaves out bare repos at any depth.

AGENTS.md says the same thing as a rule. This is the part that holds when the
agent decides otherwise. It's a backstop for honest mistakes, not a sandbox: a
command built to dodge it can.

Claude Code only. The git hook in .githooks/ is the check every tool shares.
