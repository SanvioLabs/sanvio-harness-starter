# Gates

A gate is a script that exits non-zero when work isn't ready. It checks what's
cheap to check and expensive to miss: an empty section, a placeholder left in,
a number that doesn't match its source.

Your gates go here, one per job: `gates/<job>_gate.py`. The pattern to copy is
`examples/proposal/gates/proposal_gate.py`:

- Standard library only, so it runs anywhere Python 3.9 does
- One `PASS` or `FAIL` line per file, and each problem named on its own line
- Exit 1 when anything fails, so the hook and CI can block on it
- A test in `tests/` for each thing it checks

Then add a block to `.githooks/pre-commit` that runs it on the staged files it
covers, after the ones already there, and a step to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

Never edit a gate to make work pass. Fix the work.
